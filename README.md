# Chinese Checkers

A Chinese Checkers board game developed as part of the Introduction to Computer Science course at HUJI, using Python and Pygame.

The game supports up to six human players, each assigned a distinct color. During gameplay, every move is saved automatically into a log file. Players can later:
- **Reload a saved game** to watch the progress step-by-step using arrow keys.
- **Continue playing** from the last saved point if the game ended without a winner.
